The DETE survey can be found [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey) and the TAFE exit survey can be found [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey). \n",

    "In this project, we want to get information about the following questions:\n",
    "- Are employees who only worked for the institute for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "- Are younger employees resigning to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",
