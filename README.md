# Cleaning and Analyzing Employee Exit Data

This project will work with the data set of exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. The DETE survey can be found [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey) and the TAFE exit survey can be found [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey).

In this project, we want to get information about the following questions:
- Are employees who only worked for the institute for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
- Are younger employees resigning to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
<br><br>
We want to answer these questions by combining the results for both surveys. 

The main focus of this project is applying different data cleaning techniques like correcting missing values, verified the quality of our data, and created new columns.
